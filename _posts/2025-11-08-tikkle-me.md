Sometimes I wish I could lend you my eyes  
Lend you my hips and lend you my thighs
Sometimes I wish I could take a new shape  
Switch out some parts and become a big A

Sometimes I wish I could lend you my ears  
Lend you my thoughts and lend you my tears  
Sometimes I wish I could take a new form  
Switch out some parts and become like the norm

Lucky is she, who lives unaware  
Who doesn't get bothered by those who don't care  
Lucky is she, who lives unaware  
Who doesn't get bothered by all that's unfair  
Unlucky me, who knows way too much  
Who fights to make changes and music and such  
Unlucky me, aware of the pain  
All 'cause I happen to have some brain

Sometimes I wish I could lend you my voice  
Lend you my heart and lend you my choice  
Sometimes I hope for a savior to come  
Who's got what it takes to convince everyone

Sometimes I wish I could lend you my shoes  
Lend you my life and lend you my truth  
But sometimes the truth is just my point of view  
Not what is real and not what is true

Lucky is she, who lives unaware  
Who doesn't get bothered by those who don't care  
Lucky is she, who lives unaware  
Who doesn't get bothered by all that's unfair  
Unlucky me, who knows way too much  
Who fights to make changes and music and such  
Unlucky me, aware of the pain  
All 'cause I happen to have some brain

Lucky is she, who lives unaware  
Lucky is she, who lives unaware  
Unlucky me, who knows way too much  
Who fights to make changes and music and such  
Unlucky me, aware of the pain  
All 'cause I happen to have some brain
