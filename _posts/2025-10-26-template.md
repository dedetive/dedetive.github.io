description: I'm now using Obsidian templates to run these posts
---
I'll have to agree now, Obsidian templates are kind of cool.

I've used Obsidian for years now, and when I discovered templates I used them quite too much and ended up losing all my motivation to write and worldbuild. I was getting so bored of filling the rigid boxes I set myself, as if I had an obligation to do so.

But now that I'm actually using them right, I see their value (I hope so, I haven't really read anything about them yet).

And if you do not know what Obsidian is: [Obsidian webpage](https://obsidian.md/)
