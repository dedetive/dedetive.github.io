 I had yet to explain what my purpose is with this blog. But now, here am I.
 <br>  
To be honest, it started off as a dev experiment. I just wanted to try [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and see how it works. But then, I fell into the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) rabbit hole and just enjoyed the ride.
<br>  
At first, everything was brand new and I hadn't scratched much at web dev. Previously, I made and maintained for a few months a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) deployment of a personal art project using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)'s plugin [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). A few months went on, and I decided to use that same Vercel domain to host a few very specific and niche small projects to help a group of friends play RPG. Later on, I used that same vault to host yet another project (slightly bigger, at that), going as far as using webhooks to set off automatic updates. 


But yeah, you can probably guess at this point: it was messy, and I was inexperienced.
<br>  
Time went on, and around October 2025 I felt the need to flip some switches and introduce a personal blog. I don't have any fanbase to actually read and reply what I'm writing here, but I'm not motivated by fame or recognition anyway. I write just for the sake of writing, documenting, journaling and blogging at it's finest.
<br>  
Besides, being capable of raising all of this completely on my own also adds to my experience. Especially that I did not, at any point, use AI to generate anything directly. The most I've used it was to find out niche [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) behaviors, which would be quite troublesome to read docs for, as I had to accomplish something I did not have the vocabulary for. But hey, I learned. I did not let AI do my job.
<br>  
All in all, founding CLAB was a very fun and rewarding experience, and I'm very proud of it :3


I will continue to update it, although as irregularly as I'm already doing it. I don't know if anyone will ever read this, but I'm very thankful if you do! Thank you so much, I love you!!!
