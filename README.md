## 📌 Introduction

If you're here from my resume, you might think my GitHub page is rather unprofessional. And I'd agree.  
That is indeed not my purpose with my personal GitHub page. My projects that I care dearly, however, I maintain in a more serious fashion— Go check out [Misle](https://github.com/dedetive/misle-java), which is my main open-source game project.

## 🧪 Projects 

### 🎮 Misle

- **Link:** [misle-java](https://github.com/dedetive/misle-java)
- **Description:** An open-source game, more specifically a turn-based, 2D, top-down RPG with (to come) extensive storytelling, where every choice matters.

---

### ⚙️ Dotfiles

- **Link:** [bibi-dotfiles](https://github.com/dedetive/bibi-dotfiles)
- **Description:** My personal publicly available dotfiles, which currently contains Swaylock / i3lock configuration and Sway config file.

### 🌀 Json Coding

- **Link:** [json-coding](https://github.com/dedetive/json-coding)
- **Description:** A joke idea. My plan was to be making a Turing Complete decoder of a custom-made esoteric programming language, all done in JSON files! Some of it is slightly more low-level than modern languages, such as explicit separation of sections by vars and real code, and closing the code at an `end 0` signal.
- **Note:** I have not yet made a detailed README for it, but I will soon.
